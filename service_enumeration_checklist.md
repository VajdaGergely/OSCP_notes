# Service Enumeration Checklist
## FTP
* check anonymous access
* 
## SSH
* check for vulnerable service
* bruteforce login credentials
* if private key found
  * try to login with it
  * crack passphrase if it is needed
* upload self-made ssh keys
  * for users who havent got one yet
  * override existing keys if it can be done
## SMB
* check null session and RPC
  * if allowed enumerate the shares
  * if allowed query user and system information through RPC  
* if you already have credentials
  * enumerate shares with the obtained credentials one by one (different results could be given with different users)
  * if RPC enabled  query user and system information
* if you obtained admin credentials
  * login to the machine with PsExec
* if you have a share with write permissions
  * try to upload a webshell or reverse shell that you can run or it is triggered automatically on the victim machine
* if the machine is domain joined (and you assume that user interaction is simulated)
  * start Responder and get user ntlm hash
    * that can be cracked or used in a pass the hash attack
  * start ntlmrelayx and relay ntlm traffic
* check SMB service version
  * if vulnerable use a proper exploit to that specific version
* bruteforce login credentials
  * use usernames that
    * already obtained
    * found in share folder or queried through RPC
    * root/Administrator
    * somehow seems to be a good guess (like name of HTB machine)
  * use passwords that
    * are in rockyou.txt
    * generated by the examined password policy
    * already obtained or somehow guessable
* use SMB as a file transfer method (if you have read or write permission on a share)
  * upload your tools os shell scripts to the victim through SMB
  * download your tools' outputs or sensitive files through SMB
* run random enumeration scripts against SMB and get all the accessible information that you can
  * nmap smb scripts, enum4linux, msf smb modules, smbmap, smbclient, rpcclient, ...
## HTTP (and other HTTP-like traffic e.g. web proxys, CMS systems, ...)
* nmap default scripts (-sC)
* whatweb
* gobuster
  * small list, big list
  * without extensions, with extensions (ext should matches to the webserver type)
  * recursive scans should be made when directory found (and its not publicly traversable)
* manual examination of the web content
* burp traffic analyses
## RDP
