# Service Enumeration Checklist
## FTP

## SSH
## SMB
* check null session and RPC
  * if allowed enumerate the shares
  * if allowed query user and system information through RPC

  * enumerate shares with the obtained credentials one by one (different results could be given with different users)
  * if RPC enabled  query user and system information
* if you obtained admin credentials
  * login to the machine with PsExec
* if the machine is domain joined (and you assume that user interaction is simulated)
  * start Responder and get user ntlm hash
    * that can be cracked or used in a pass the hash attack
  * start ntlmrelayx and relay ntlm traffic
* check SMB service version
  * if vulnerable use a proper exploit to that specific version
* bruteforce login credentials
  * use usernames that
    * already obtained
    * found in share folder or queried through RPC
    * root/Administrator
    * somehow seems to be a good guess (like name of HTB machine)
  * use passwords that
    * are in rockyou.txt
    * generated by the examined password policy
    * already obtained or somehow guessable
## HTTP (and other HTTP-like traffic e.g. web proxys, CMS systems, ...)
