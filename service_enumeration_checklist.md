# Service Enumeration Checklist
## FTP
* check anonymous access
* 
## SSH
## SMB
* check null session
  * if allowed enumerate the shares
* check RPC
  * if allowed query user and system information
* check version
  * if vulnerable use a proper exploit to that specific version
* bruteforce login credentials
  * use usernames -> that already obtained, root/Administrator, somehow seems to be a good guess (like name of HTB machine)
  * use passwords -> in rockyou.txt, generated by examined password policy, already obtained, somehow guessable
## HTTP (and other HTTP-like traffic e.g. web proxys, CMS systems, ...)
* nmap default scripts (-sC)
* whatweb
* gobuster
## RDP
